## The Problem

Your to-do list is scattered across a dozen apps. Action items hide in email threads. Requests get lost in Slack. Calendar invites bury the actual work. By the time you've checked everything, half your morning is gone—and you still don't know what to focus on.

## The Solution

**Peek** is a native macOS app that watches your digital life and surfaces what actually matters. One keyboard shortcut. One view. Everything you need to do today.

Press `⌘0` and Peek appears—a beautiful, minimal command palette showing your tasks, intelligently prioritized and ready for action.

---

## Features

### Instant Access
Peek lives in the background until you need it. Hit `⌘0` from anywhere and your task list appears instantly. No app switching. No context loss. Just a quick peek at what's next.

### AI-Powered Task Extraction
Peek connects to your email and Slack, using AI to identify actionable items hiding in your messages. That "can you send me the report by Friday?" buried in a thread? Peek finds it, creates a task, and sets the deadline—automatically.

### Smart Prioritization
Not all tasks are created equal. Peek's AI analyzes urgency, deadlines, and context to suggest what you should tackle first. Stop deciding what to do and start doing it.

### Daily Planning
Start each day with intention. Peek's Daily Planner looks at your calendar, estimates task durations, and helps you build a realistic schedule around your meetings. Know exactly what you can accomplish before your first coffee gets cold.

### Natural Language Input
Type tasks the way you think. "Call Mom tomorrow p1" creates a high-priority task due tomorrow. Peek understands dates, priorities, projects, and time estimates from plain English.

### Keyboard-First Design
Built for power users who live in their keyboards. Navigate, create, complete, and archive tasks without ever touching your mouse. Every action has a shortcut.

## How It Works

1. **Connect** your Gmail, Slack, and Calendar
2. **Sync** to pull in messages and events
3. **Review** AI-extracted tasks with one click to import
4. **Plan** your day around your calendar
5. **Execute** with focus, crossing off tasks as you go

Peek doesn't replace your existing tools—it watches them and tells you what needs your attention.
